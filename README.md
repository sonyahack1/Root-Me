# RootMe Writeups

<img src="./screenshots/rootme.png" alt="Logo"/>

---
Welcome to my personal collection of writeups for machines and challenges on [Root Me](https://www.root-me.org/).
Each writeup includes my thought process, tools used, exploitation steps, and post-exploitation notes.

Periodically I will return to the laboratories and machines I have completed and make any changes or improvements to my solutions.
